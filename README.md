# UK-house-price-prediction-by-using-time-series-analysis-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Models
This project focuses on forecasting UK house prices using multiple statistical and machine-learning models. The goal is to analyse long-term price behaviour, identify underlying patterns, and evaluate which model offers the highest predictive accuracy.

---

## Project Summary
This project predicts future UK house prices using monthly data from the UK House Price Index (1995–2024).  
Several models were built and evaluated to identify the most accurate forecasting approach.

**Models Implemented**
- ARIMA  
- SARIMA  
- LSTM  
- Linear Regression with lag features  

**Outcome:**  
Despite being the simplest model, **Linear Regression delivered the highest accuracy**, outperforming ARIMA, SARIMA, and even LSTM.
